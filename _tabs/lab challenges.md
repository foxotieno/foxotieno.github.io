### 🏮 Sakura CTF Challenge

*Platform:* [TryHackMe - Sakura](https://tryhackme.com/room/sakura)

#### 🧠 Problem Statement
The *Sakura* challenge involves investigating a web application to uncover hidden flags by exploiting web vulnerabilities and analyzing user inputs. The main objective is to understand and bypass access controls, identify misconfigurations, and retrieve sensitive data.

#### 🧩 Approach and Tools Used
- *Approach:*
  1. Performed initial reconnaissance using nmap to identify open ports and services.
  2. Used dirb and gobuster to discover hidden directories.
  3. Interacted with the web application and captured requests via Burp Suite.
  4. Detected and exploited an insecure input validation flaw to gain access to the flag.
- *Tools:*
  - Nmap  
  - Burp Suite  
  - Gobuster  
  - Linux terminal utilities  

#### 🎯 Key Lessons Learnt
- Importance of enumerating hidden directories and endpoints.
- Gaining proficiency with Burp Suite intercepts and request tampering.
- Reinforced knowledge of common web vulnerabilities and how to patch them.

### 🕵‍♂ Ohsint CTF Challenge

*Platform:* [TryHackMe - Ohsint](https://tryhackme.com/room/ohsint)

#### 🧠 Problem Statement
The *Ohsint* challenge focuses on open-source intelligence (OSINT). The goal is to gather as much information as possible from publicly available sources to trace digital footprints and extract hidden data.

#### 🧩 Approach and Tools Used
- *Approach:*
  1. Started with an image and a username as initial clues.
  2. Conducted reverse image searches using Google Images and TinEye.
  3. Used social media and domain lookup tools to correlate data.
  4. Followed digital breadcrumbs to uncover the final flag.
- *Tools:*
  - Google Search & Reverse Image Search  
  - TinEye  
  - whois & nslookup  
  - Social media OSINT techniques  

#### 🎯 Key Lessons Learnt
- Strengthened understanding of *digital footprint tracing* and *metadata extraction*.
- Learned to use *OSINT frameworks* and manual investigation techniques effectively.
- Gained appreciation for privacy awareness and data minimization in online presence.
